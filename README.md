## Description:
This app supports the following functionality:
Users should be able to submit an amount and a description in the appropriate fields.

The amount that is submitted should accept a positive or negative value. If the amount is positive it is an income, while if it is negative, it is a expense.

The description and amount cannot be empty, if it is, it must not attempt to create a new Transaction.
If the form submission is successful, it creates a new line in either the income - in the expense or the income column.

Each expense item should show its percentage relative to the total income. For example, if your expense is $10 and the total income so far is $100, then 10% will be included beside it.
The current Month's date is added to the top of the page as well as to each income and expense item.
